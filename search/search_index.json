It has a set of predefined text colors and styles that can be used for any terminal output. Installation The package is distributed through maven central. dependencies { implementation(\"io.github.isiosis.stilum:stilum:0.1.1\") } Usage Sample usages import io.github.isiosis.stilum.Stilum import io.github.isiosis.stilum.Color fun main() { val terminal = Stilum(foregroundColor = Color.red) terminal.println(\"This output should be red\") } The above usage should output the following Stilum that can be used as pre styled output element or through it's companion object, it can be used to style elements on the fly. Usage through an instantiated Stilum Object To use Stilum through an instantiated object, which contains it's own class styling, simply instantiate a new Stilum class and pass the desired parameters to the constructor. There are three parameters that can be passed, foregroundColor , backgroundColor and fontStyle . Each of those can be used from the equivalently named classes inside the Stilum package. Here's an example usage val terminal = Stilum(foregroundColor=Color.red, backgroundColor=Color.blue, fontStyle=FontStyle.bold) Then doing terminal.println(\"This message should have a red foreground, blue background and bold font) will produce the expected result. Note : the explicit styling set for a specific class will take precedence over any styles that are later applied during printing. For example, while this is possible val terminal = Stilum(fontStyle=FontStyle.bold) terminal.println(\"This message should be italic\", fontStyle=FontStyle.italic) The output will still be bold since the class style takes precedence over the style applied later. Usage through the static println method of Stilum This provides a quick setup and way to style outputs without creating a styled class in Stilum. To use the class this way: Stilum.println(\"This message should be yellow\", foregroundColor=Color.yellow) less verbose ways to specify the desired style also exist such as: Stilum.println(bold(\"this message should be bold\")) // this can then be combined with further styling Stilum.println(red(bold(\"this message should be bold and red\"))) When nesting styles this way, the outermost styling will take precedence if the applied styles are changing the same attribute. Usage through extension methods on the String class Stilum also has extension functions for the String class, which after being imported, can be used like this: import io.github.isiosis.Stilum.extensions.* fun main() { kotlin.io.println(\"this text should be red and bold\".red().bold()) }","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"Stilum is a simple terminal output styler for Kotlin.
